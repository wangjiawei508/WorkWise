# Generate PPTX Route

> Load only after [`routing.md`](./routing.md) selects Generate PPTX. This file owns the route's Step 1–7 sequence, gates, role switching, and mandatory commands.

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → [Template] → Strategist Structured Plan → [Image_Generator] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export`

**Generate-specific execution discipline**:

- The current main agent hand-writes every SVG page; never delegate page generation or run a Python, Node, or shell generator over `svg_output/`.
- Initial SVG cadence: P01 → first-page gate → uninterrupted remaining pages → final gate. Grouped batches and mid-run checker calls are forbidden.
- Before each page, load compact page-context; its lock projection guards drift while unchanged large references stay in context.
- `preset_shape_svg.py` may provide one stdout fragment only after the main agent chooses its semantic role, frame, and paint; it cannot choose layout or write a page.

### SVG Page-Design Boundary

| Scope | Contract |
|---|---|
| Any route that authors or regenerates slide visuals through SVG | `svg_output/` is the complete page-design source: every visible text, image, shape, chart/table fallback, and layout element that should appear on the exported slide is present in that page SVG or referenced by it. |
| Templates, `design_spec.md`, and `spec_lock.md` | Authoring/control inputs. They guide SVG creation but MUST NOT supply visible slide content that is absent from the completed SVG during export. |
| Semantic SVG markers | Minimal rendering-neutral compiler hints used only after existing Layout/Layer/Placeholder/Native metadata has been considered. They never replace native SVG geometry, text, styles, grouping, or asset references. |
| `svg_final/` | Mandatory derived, self-contained SVG visual preview. It may be opened directly or inserted into PowerPoint as an SVG picture, but it is not a supported PPTX source and carries no manual Convert-to-Shape compatibility contract. |
| SVG-to-PPTX export | The only supported generated-PPTX route reads `svg_output/` and maps its content through the project converter to DrawingML/native objects. It compiles only the selected route's explicit structure contract: `flat` keeps represented content Slide-local, while `structured` may place explicitly scoped content in Master/Layout/Slide parts. It MUST NOT infer structure, upgrade `flat`, or invent new visible page content. |
| Native PPTX routes and presentation-behavior stages | Remain outside SVG page-design closure. `template-fill-pptx`, `native-enhance-pptx`, animations, transitions, speaker notes, narration, and package relationships are not required to round-trip through SVG. |

**MUST — page-design closure**: For an SVG-authoring route, inspect the final page SVG to determine what the exported slide looks like. Do not reinterpret “SVG is the page-design language” as “SVG is the complete PPTX package description language.”

## Cross-Cutting Authorities

| Concern | Authority | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Main pipeline sequencing | This file | Owns Step 1–7 order, gates, role switching, and mandatory commands |
| Artifact ownership | [`artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md) | Owns fact channels, source/derived artifact boundaries, and regeneration rules |
| Failure recovery | [`failure-recovery.md`](./governance/failure-recovery.md) | Owns stop/continue policy and resume pointers |
| Confirm UI details | [`confirm_ui.md`](../scripts/docs/confirm_ui.md) | Owns the JSON schema, launcher behavior, staged-result contract, port strategy, and chat fallback details |
| Explicit template workspace | [`apply-template-workspace.md`](./stages/apply-template-workspace.md) | Owns Step 3 validation, installation, and fusion; load only when Step 3's explicit-path trigger fires |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Source Content Processing

🚧 **GATE**: User has provided source material (PDF / DOCX / EPUB / URL / Markdown file / text description / conversation content — any form is acceptable).

> **No source content?** When the user supplies only a topic name or requirements without any file or substantive description, run the [`topic-research`](stages/topic-research.md) intake stage first, then return here with its products as input.

When the user provides non-Markdown content, convert immediately through the
unified dispatcher. It preserves the backend converters' existing behavior,
routes by source type, and writes the standard Markdown plus conversion profile.

| User Provides | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| PDF / DOCX / Office document / XLSX / XLSM / PPTX / EPUB / HTML / LaTeX / RST / web URL | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/source_to_md.py <file_or_URL_or_dir> [<file_or_URL_or_dir> ...]` |
| CSV / TSV | Read directly as plain-text table source |
| Markdown | Read directly |

For PPTX sources, Step 1 converts the deck to Markdown content; after Step 2
`import-sources`, standard PPTX intake is also written to `<project>/analysis/`.
Use `source_to_md.py -t <type>` only when extension detection is ambiguous.
Default local conversion writes Markdown/profile outputs beside each source file.
Use `-o` only when a specific output file/directory is required; with multiple
inputs or directory inputs, `-o` is an output directory. Backend converter details are documented in
[`scripts/docs/conversion.md`](../scripts/docs/conversion.md).

> **Office vector assets (EMF/WMF) from DOCX/PPTX sources**:
> Source conversion extracts embedded Office vector images (.emf/.wmf)
> alongside bitmap images when the source format exposes them. After `import-sources`, these land in `images/`
> together with `image_manifest.json` and are first-class assets in §VIII Image Resource List.
>
> **Do NOT convert EMF/WMF to PNG.** The PPT Master pipeline preserves them as external
> references (`finalize_svg.py` skips them) and `svg_to_pptx.py` embeds them as
> PPTX-native media via `image/x-emf` / `image/x-wmf` MIME — PowerPoint renders them at full vector fidelity.
> Converting via LibreOffice/Inkscape introduces CJK font substitution drift and
> rasterization loss; the original EMF/WMF is always higher fidelity than the converted PNG.
>
> Browser-based live preview cannot render EMF (will show blank) — this is expected;
> the PPTX output is the source of truth.

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm source content is ready, proceed to Step 2.**

---

### Step 2: Project Initialization

🚧 **GATE**: Step 1 complete; source content is ready (Markdown file, user-provided text, or requirements described in conversation are all valid).

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> --format <format>
```

Format options must be named with concrete dimensions. Default: `ppt169` = `1280x720`, `viewBox="0 0 1280 720"`. Other examples: `ppt43` = `1024x768`, `story` = `1080x1920`, `banner` = `1920x1080`. For the full format list, see `references/canvas-formats.md`.

Import source content (choose based on the situation):

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Has source files (PDF/MD/etc.) | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py import-sources <project_path> <source_files_or_dirs...> --move` |
| User provided text directly in conversation | No import needed — content is already in conversation context; subsequent steps can reference it directly |

For PPTX sources, `import-sources` automatically runs the standard intake enrichment:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pptx_intake.py <project_path>/sources/<source.pptx> -o <project_path>/analysis
```

For each PPTX it writes `<stem>.identity.json` (canvas, theme palette/fonts, observed usage) and `<stem>.slide_library.json` (text slots, geometry, native tables, native chart caches, SmartArt nodes/connections), and merges that deck's Strategist-facing digest into the single multi-deck index `analysis/source_profile.json` (`decks[]`, one self-contained entry per source deck, with prefixed artifact pointers). In the main generation path these are source facts and recommendation candidates, not replica constraints; the beautify profile and Fill Native PPTX route decide separately which fields become locked constraints.

Multi-deck: several PPTX files may be imported into one main-pipeline project — each gets its own `<stem>.*` artifacts and a deck entry in `source_profile.json`. `source_profile.json` stays the single must-read index (one entry for a one-deck project, several for a combined-source project). Stems must be distinct; re-importing the same stem replaces that deck's entry. The beautify profile and Fill Native PPTX route remain single-deck (1:1 to one chosen source deck) and read that deck's `<stem>.*` artifacts.

> ⚠️ **MUST use `--move`** (not copy): all source files — Step 1's generated Markdown, original PDFs / MDs / images — go into `sources/` via `import-sources --move`. If Step 1 wrote Markdown beside the original sources, pass that source path/directory once. If Step 1 used `-o` to write Markdown elsewhere, pass both the original source path(s)/directory and the Markdown output path(s)/directory. After execution they no longer exist at the original location, and a source directory left empty by the move is removed automatically. Intermediate artifacts (e.g., `_files/`) are handled automatically.

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm project structure created successfully, `sources/` contains all source files, converted materials are ready. Proceed to Step 3.**

---

### Step 3: Template Option

🚧 **GATE**: Step 2 complete; project directory structure is ready.

**Default — free design**: Proceed directly to Step 4. Do not query any `*_index.json`, ask about templates, suggest a local template, or fuzzy-match a name from content, brand mentions, or style language.

**Explicit-path trigger only**: Load and run [`apply-template-workspace.md`](./stages/apply-template-workspace.md) only when either condition is true:

- The user supplied one or more explicit workspace-root paths.
- Create Template completed in the current conversation and handed off its exact validated workspace root.

Bare names, style descriptions, brand mentions, vague template intent, and silence do not trigger the runbook. There is no slug lookup or fuzzy path resolution.

**Raw PPTX boundary**: A raw PPTX remains valid source material, but it is not a Step 3 workspace. Raw PPTX plus new content uses [`template-fill-pptx`](./template-fill-pptx.md). To create a reusable workspace, run [`create-template`](./create-template.md), then return with the generated root. Never add Master/Layout/placeholder structure directly to an existing PPTX or SVG project.

> “What templates exist?” is out-of-band Q&A. List indexed workspace paths, then stop; listing does not trigger Step 3. The user must send an explicit path.

**✅ Checkpoint**: Free design selected without loading template details, or the conditional template runbook completed and `<project_path>/templates/` plus any portable assets are ready.

---

### Step 4: Strategist Phase (MANDATORY — cannot be skipped)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 3 complete; default free-design path taken, or (if triggered) template files copied or confirmed in place in the project.

First, read the role core, then only the modules triggered by the current plan:
```
Read references/strategist.md
```

| Deterministic trigger | Additional Strategist reference |
|---|---|
| Step 3 installed an explicit Brand/Layout/Deck workspace | `references/strategist-template.md` |
| The core's proposed Stage 2 `image_usage` contains a source other than `none`, the user supplied an explicit non-`none` image constraint, or formula-worthy content activates formula planning | `references/strategist-image.md` before authoring image renderings, production detail, formula resources, or §VIII |

The core first chooses the proposed Stage 2 source ids. Load the image module before writing Stage 2 whenever that proposal is non-`none`; after confirmation, keep it active only for confirmed non-`none` sources or an active formula plan. A confirmed `none` path with no formula work writes no image rows. Bare template names and style language do not load the template module.

> ⚠️ **Mandatory artifact gates**: scaffold the human-readable `design_spec.md` first; after it passes confirmation fidelity, scaffold the machine-readable `spec_lock.md` and project from the Design Spec. Do not reconstruct either grammar from memory. The design schema keeps the brief readable and page-projectable; the lock schema keeps its execution projection machine-readable. Cross-file textual equality is not required, but semantic projection fidelity is. Reference indexes are for troubleshooting, not normal generation load.

**Artifact ownership**: fact-channel and source/derived artifact boundaries are defined in [`references/artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md). This Step uses those ownership rules; it does not redefine them.

**`<project_path>/analysis/` is the project's intermediate-analysis folder: the canonical home for machine-extracted source/asset facts — the PPTX intake bundle (`source_profile.json` index + per-deck `<stem>.identity.json` / `<stem>.slide_library.json`) and `image_analysis.csv`. It holds facts, not design contracts — `design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md` stay at the project root.** The MUST-read contract covers only the **compact structured data files (`.json` / `.csv`)**; other artifacts that may live under `analysis/` (e.g. a beautify `source_svg_import/` vector reference package) are NOT bulk-read — they are read selectively only when a specific workflow step calls for them. Before the Strategist confirmation stage, Strategist MUST read the auto-extracted fact files already in `analysis/` — currently `source_profile.json` (PPTX intake), when present. This file is the multi-deck index: read it once for the `decks[]` digests (canvas / chart / table / SmartArt entries per source deck), then open a specific deck's `<stem>.identity.json` / `<stem>.slide_library.json` only if you need its full raw facts. Use these entries as **factual source context** (format default + content facts); when several decks are present, synthesize across all of them. The source's **palette / typography / visual identity are a reference, not a constraint**: the main pipeline may inherit them where they fit the content and the confirmed style, or design fresh where they don't — the Strategist's judgment, never an obligation to either keep or discard. (Template-fill preserves the native source design by editing cloned slides directly; beautify defaults to the source identity but still follows the confirmed values; the main pipeline treats source identity as reference only and defaults to fresh design.) (`image_analysis.csv` lands later, at the image-analysis step below, and is the authoritative regenerated image-fact view there — re-derived from the live `images/` folder, not a durable store.)

**Channel ownership — read each fact once from its owning channel.** In the main pipeline the **content contract is the content-type files in `sources/`** — primarily `<stem>.md`, but also any user-supplied content the import archived there: `.md` / `.markdown` / `.txt` / `.csv` / `.tsv` / `.json` / `.jsonl` / `.yaml` / `.yml` (a `metrics.json` or `data.csv` may carry core content — judge by what the file holds). Text, tables, chart data values, and SmartArt node wording come from these (`ppt_to_md` transcribes native charts as Markdown tables and SmartArt nodes as hierarchical bullets). **Do NOT read pipeline sidecars in `sources/` as content**: `*.conversion_profile.json` (conversion audit) and `*_files/image_manifest.json` (asset index) are process metadata — open them only to audit a conversion or resolve assets, never as slide content. Converted-source originals archived in `sources/` (`.pdf` / `.pptx` / `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.html` / `.epub` / `.tex` / `.rst` / `.ipynb` / `.typ`, etc.) are read via their converted `<stem>.md`, not scanned directly in the main pipeline. The `analysis/` chart / table / diagram entries are a **structural digest** for outline decisions (which slides carried charts, tables, or SmartArt; chart types / series names; SmartArt layout and hierarchy) — not a second copy of the content values; do NOT also pull chart values or SmartArt wording from `<stem>.slide_library.json` in the main pipeline. The `<stem>.slide_library.json` full structured data is owned by the direct-PPTX workflows: template-fill uses it as the native fill contract while preserving SmartArt unchanged; beautify uses it for native chart / table data and SmartArt relationships while keeping all wording from the Markdown.

**Confirmation orchestration**: field meaning and recommendation logic belong to the active Strategist modules; [`confirm_ui.md`](../scripts/docs/confirm_ui.md) owns the JSON schema, server lifecycle, staged-result contract, port behavior, and equivalent chat fallback.

⛔ **BLOCKING**: Unless explicitly delegated, final confirmation is the single user gate. Keep Stage 1/2 handoffs in one turn; after each wait, author the next stage without chat. Author each stage once; submitted values—including blanks or unusual overrides—are authoritative.

**Confirmation ownership and surface**: Only the user confirms. Default Stage 1 is `--daemon --wait`; use chat only by explicit chat-only/delegation or after launch failure/timeout plus a `result.json` re-check. Chat tools do not replace launch. The agent may write recommendations, operate the server, and read state, but MUST NOT call `/api/confirm`, automate submission, synthesize a payload, or write/replace `result.json`. Delegation applies only to this run: show the complete three-stage summary and never fabricate UI results. Silence confirms nothing.

| Stage | Strategist writes | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `stage1` | Communication contract, `content_divergence`, and canvas only | `status: stage1-confirmed` |
| `stage2` | Complete deck solution from the confirmed contract; never skip for a template | `status: stage2-confirmed` |
| `stage3` | Production mechanics only: conditional AI path, formula policy, generation mode, refine-spec | `stage: final`, `status: confirmed` |

1. Write Stage 1 `confirm_ui/recommendations.json` per the Confirm UI contract, then launch and wait:

   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --daemon --wait
   ```

2. Read the Stage 1 result. Derive proposed image sources in core and load `strategist-image.md` before constructing Stage 2 when its trigger fires; apply `strategist-template.md` when active. Overwrite the recommendations with Stage 2, then wait:

   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --wait-only --wait-stage stage2
   ```

3. Read the Stage 2 result, overwrite recommendations with Stage 3, then perform the final blocking wait:

   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --wait-only
   ```

4. After the final wait returns, re-read the complete `result.json` even when the wait succeeded. Proceed from the file only when it carries `stage: final` and `status: confirmed`. On a non-zero wait, perform this same read before using the documented chat fallback. A stage-skip result returns to the missing stage; it is not a browser failure.

5. After final confirmation or chat fallback, always release the server:

   ```bash
   python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/confirm_ui/server.py <project_path> --shutdown
   ```

If the user opted out of the page but did not delegate confirmation, skip launch and run the same three stages in chat with explicit user responses. If the user explicitly delegated confirmation, consolidate the same three stages into one AI-authored summary and proceed without `result.json`. Otherwise report the launch URL and keep the staged chat summaries available as fallback.

⛔ **GATE — write the Design Spec from the final state, then project the lock.** Treat every explicitly present final value as a user-owned Design Spec requirement. The Strategist may autonomously elaborate only unconfirmed implementation details; it must not omit, delete, substitute, narrow, weaken, reinterpret, or re-recommend a confirmed value. First author and audit the complete `design_spec.md` through [`strategist.md`](../references/strategist.md) §6.2, including every confirmed image source and explicit `image_notes` role. Only after that audit passes, derive `spec_lock.md` from the completed Design Spec without making another design decision. Apply `strategist-template.md` §3 for an active template, and never write a separate image palette. If one confirmed value cannot be honored, follow [`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md) instead of silently changing it.

**Mandatory — split-mode note** (not a separate confirmation): after listing the Strategist confirmation stage details, you MUST append exactly one short line (rendered in the user's language, prefixed with 💡) about generation mode. Pick the variant by qualitative read of upstream-load signals — recommended page count, source-material bulk, whether `topic-research` ran with substantial web-fetch accumulation:

| Signal read | Line content |
|---|---|
| Heavy (long page count / bulky sources / heavy web-fetch accumulation) | State estimated page count and large source size; recommend switching to [split mode](stages/resume-execute.md) after Step 5 — stop this chat, open a fresh window and input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` to enter the execution session (SVG generation + export); no response or "continue" = default continuous mode. |
| Normal (default) | State scale is moderate, default continuous mode generates in one go; if mid-way window switch is desired, input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` after Step 5 to switch to [split mode](stages/resume-execute.md). |

This line is required output every run — the user must always see the mode choice exists. Whether to act on it is the user's call. When the Confirm UI is used, this choice also appears as the in-page generation-mode toggle and is captured in `result.json` (`generation_mode`); the chat-summary fallback still prints this line.

**Mandatory — spec-refinement note** (not a separate confirmation): after the split-mode line, you MUST append one short opt-in line (rendered in the user's language, prefixed with 💡) telling the user they may **refine the spec first** — Strategist will produce the full design spec, then stop for review/revision of any part of it before any generation, via the [refine-spec](stages/refine-spec.md) stage. Default is OFF: no request → the spec is written in one go and the pipeline auto-proceeds as usual. Only when the user explicitly asks in chat (e.g. "refine the spec first") or confirms `refine_spec: true` through Confirm UI does the [refine-spec](stages/refine-spec.md) stage take over after the Strategist confirmation stage. This line, like the split-mode line, is required output every run — the user must see the choice exists; whether to act on it is theirs. When the Confirm UI is used, this choice also appears as the in-page refine-spec toggle and is captured in `result.json` (`refine_spec`); the chat-summary fallback still prints this line.

**Formula policy**: Stage 3 confirms `mixed`, `render-all`, or `text-only`. When the confirmed policy requires rendering formula-worthy content, load [`strategist-image.md`](../references/strategist-image.md) even if `image_usage` is `none`, and follow its formula-resource contract before filling the planning artifacts. `text-only` creates no formula image rows.

If the user provided images or formula PNGs were rendered, run analysis **before outputting the design spec**. It writes `analysis/image_analysis.csv` — the authoritative regenerated image-fact view in the `analysis/` folder, which MUST be read before authoring §VIII:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

> 🔁 **Image facts are regenerated on demand, never a durable store.** `images/` is a live working folder — pictures are extracted from the source at import, the user may drop or replace files at any time, and Step 5 writes web/AI images into it. The single source of truth is therefore the **current contents of `images/`**, and `analysis/image_analysis.csv` is a *regenerated view* of it, not a fact to keep in sync. Re-run `analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` immediately **before any step that reads image facts** so the view reflects the live folder: before the image-source recommendation (see [strategist.md](../references/strategist.md) §h), here before authoring §VIII, after Step 5 acquisition (so web/AI files join the view), and again any time the user says they added or replaced images. This is the staleness strategy — re-derive on use, no cache to invalidate.

> ⚠️ **Image handling**: NEVER directly read / open / view image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.). All image info comes from `analyze_images.py` output (`analysis/image_analysis.csv`) or the Design Spec's Image Resource List.

**Output**:
- `<project_path>/design_spec.md` — human-readable design narrative
- `<project_path>/spec_lock.md` — machine-readable communication + execution contract; Executor consumes its current-page projection from `page-context`

For a new project, scaffold the Design Spec after final confirmation; the command refuses to overwrite an existing artifact:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-spec <project_path>
```

Fill and audit `design_spec.md` against the complete final confirmation. Only after that audit passes, scaffold and fill the machine lock from the completed Design Spec:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py scaffold-lock <project_path>
```

After filling the lock, compare its machine-relevant values against the completed Design Spec, then run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py validate <project_path>`. A `result.json` → Design Spec mismatch or Design Spec → lock projection mismatch is blocking even when the standalone Markdown schemas pass. `validate` mechanically enforces one slice of this: with a final confirmed `confirm_ui/result.json`, every confirmed non-`none` `image_usage` source must be represented by at least one `## images` row (`ai` is also satisfied by `slice`); the remaining semantic comparison stays with this gate. Repair the Design Spec only from the final confirmation state, then re-project the affected lock rows. A resume path edits existing files in the same order and never re-scaffolds them.

**✅ Checkpoint — Phase deliverables complete, auto-proceed to next step**:
```markdown
## ✅ Strategist Phase Complete
- [x] Read the auto-extracted facts already in `analysis/` (e.g. `source_profile.json`) before the Strategist confirmation stage
- [x] Strategist confirmation stage completed (user confirmed via Confirm UI `result.json` or chat fallback)
- [x] Final confirmation re-read before Design Spec authoring
- [x] Split-mode note appended below the confirmation fields (heavy or normal variant)
- [x] Spec-refinement opt-in line appended (default OFF; only the user's explicit request enters the refine-spec stage)
- [x] Design Specification & Content Outline generated
- [x] Gate 1 passed: Design Spec preserves every confirmed value
- [x] Execution lock (`spec_lock.md`) projected from the completed Design Spec with no independent design decision
- [x] Communication trace validated: Design Spec retains the contract; the lock has compact `audience` / `objective` / `core_message` fields (plus PPT `consumption_mode`); every §IX Slide has an `Audience move`
- [ ] **Next**: Auto-proceed to [Image_Generator / Executor] phase
```

---

### Step 5: Image Acquisition Phase (Conditional)

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 complete; `<project_path>/design_spec.md` and `<project_path>/spec_lock.md` both exist. If either required artifact is missing, stop before any acquisition or generation and follow [`failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md) §3. Formula rows already have `Acquire Via: formula` and status `Rendered` or `Needs-Manual`.

> **Trigger**: At least one row in the resource list has `Acquire Via: ai`, `web`, and/or `slice`. If every row is `user`, `formula`, or `placeholder`, skip to Step 6. A final confirmation that selected `ai` or `web` without a matching §VIII resource row is an incomplete Design Spec, not a reason to skip Step 5; return to Step 4 Gate 1, repair the Design Spec from the final confirmation, and re-project the lock.

**Failure recovery**: stop/continue behavior for AI/web/slice/image-readiness failures is defined in [`workflows/governance/failure-recovery.md`](governance/failure-recovery.md). This Step keeps the acquisition procedure.

**Always load the common framework**:

```
Read references/image-base.md
```

Then **lazy-load the path-specific reference** for each row that actually needs it:

| Acquire Via | Load reference (only if any such row exists) | Run |
|---|---|---|
| `ai` | `references/image-generator.md` | write `<project_path>/images/image_prompts.json`, then follow `image-generator.md §7 Path Selection` (`image_gen.py --manifest` is **Path A only**) |
| `web` | `references/image-searcher.md` | `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_search.py ...` (≥2 web rows → `--batch images/image_queries.json`) |
| `slice` | `references/image-generator.md` §4.3 | derived — **after** the parent `ai` sheet row is `Generated`, run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/slice_images.py <project_path>/images/<sheet>.png --grid RxC --names ... --trim --alpha` (see workflow step 2.5) |
| `user` / `formula` / `placeholder` | (skip) | (skip) |

A deck with only `ai` rows never loads `image-searcher.md`; a deck with only `web` rows never loads `image-generator.md`. A mixed deck loads both, processes each row through its own path, and writes both `image_prompts.json` and `image_sources.json`.

> ⚠️ **In-pipeline ai rows MUST use the manifest contract** — even when only 1 ai row exists. Always write `images/image_prompts.json` first and render `image_prompts.md` with `image_gen.py --render-md`. Then execute the confirmed path from `image-generator.md §7`: `image_gen.py --manifest` is **Path A only**; `host-native` is **Path B** and MUST skip `--manifest`; `manual` writes the prompts and stops for external generation. The positional form (`image_gen.py "prompt" ...`) is reserved for **out-of-pipeline one-off testing / single-image fixups** — it skips manifest + sidecar, leaving no audit trail.

> ⚠️ **web path — batch multiple rows**: when ≥2 rows are `Acquire Via: web`, write all queries into `images/image_queries.json` and run `image_search.py --batch` once (concurrent acquisition, status written back), instead of one CLI call per row. A single web row may use the positional single-query form. See [image-searcher.md](../references/image-searcher.md) §5.

> 💡 **ai path — spot illustrations as one sheet**: when the §VIII image resource plan needs ≥3 same-family spot illustrations as decorative accessories, generate **one grid sheet** (a single `ai` sheet row) instead of one row per element, then slice it (workflow step 2.5 below). Choose sheet geometry from intended placement: `1xN` / `Nx1` are useful for extreme portrait / landscape cells, and a designed `MxN` grid is valid when its cell ratio fits the planned elements. The sheet row is generated but not placed; each cut **element row** (`Acquire Via: slice`) is placed and must appear in `spec_lock.md images`. One generation = one coherent style across all pieces. Resource contract + the geometry rules: [image-generator.md](../references/image-generator.md) §4.3.

> ⚠️ **Honor the confirmed image source before running any generation command**: the `ai` generation path (Path A = `image_gen.py` API / Path B = host-native tool / Offline Manual) is **not** auto-only — a confirmed choice other than `auto` wins, whether it came from chat (canonical) or, when the page was used, `result.json.image_ai_path`. `host-native` forces Path B even when `IMAGE_BACKEND` is configured; `api` forces Path A; `manual` forces offline. Never run `image_gen.py --manifest` when the confirmed value is `host-native` or `manual`. Full selection rule: [image-generator.md](../references/image-generator.md) §7 Path Selection.

Workflow:

1. Extract all resource rows from the design spec and group them by `Acquire Via`; rows with `Status: Pending` or `Status: Failed` and `Acquire Via ∈ {ai, web, slice}` must all reach a terminal state before Executor starts
2. Generate prompts (ai rows) and/or run search (web rows) per [image-base.md](../references/image-base.md) §3 dispatch table
2.5. **Slice any spot-illustration sheets (only if `slice` rows exist).** For each generated `ai` **sheet** row, run `slice_images.py` (grid + the element `--names` matching the `slice` rows, `--trim --alpha`) so every element file lands in `images/`; mark each `slice` row `Generated`. A sheet still in `Needs-Manual` cannot be sliced — leave its `slice` rows `Needs-Manual` and surface them at the Step 7 readiness gate. Contract: [image-generator.md](../references/image-generator.md) §4.3.
3. Verify every row reaches a terminal status: `Generated` (ai success / sliced element), `Sourced` (web success), or `Needs-Manual`. `Failed` is not a terminal status: it means the current run did not generate that item, but the item remains retryable. On `auto`, follow the owning fallback chain. On an explicitly confirmed `api` or `host-native` path, retry only that path; if it still fails, mark the row `Needs-Manual` without switching to another automated provider.
4. Re-derive image facts now that web / AI / sliced files are in the folder — `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` — so `analysis/image_analysis.csv` reflects every acquired image **including the sliced elements** (real measured sizes) before the Executor lays them out. Image facts are regenerated on use, never a stale store (see Step 4's image-facts note).

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm acquisition attempted for every row**:
```markdown
## ✅ Image Acquisition Phase Complete
- [x] image_prompts.json created (when any ai rows processed)
- [x] image_prompts.md sidecar rendered (when any ai rows processed)
- [x] image_sources.json created (when any web rows processed)
- [x] Spot-illustration sheets sliced (when any `slice` rows exist); every element file present in `images/` and listed in `spec_lock.md images`
- [x] Each row: status is `Generated` / `Sourced` / `Needs-Manual` (no `Pending` or `Failed` remaining)
- [x] analyze_images.py re-run so image_analysis.csv covers the acquired web / AI / sliced images
```

**Default — auto-proceed to Step 6.** Only when the user's Step 4 response explicitly opted into split mode (in chat or via Confirm UI `result.json` with `generation_mode: "split"`), output the planning-session handoff below and stop this conversation:

  ```markdown
  ## ✅ Planning Session Complete
  - [x] Spec: `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`
  - [x] Resources: `sources/`, `images/`, `templates/`
  - [ ] **Next**: open a fresh chat window and input `继续生成 projects/<project_name>` to enter the execution session via the [`resume-execute`](stages/resume-execute.md) stage.
  ```

> On acquisition failure, do NOT halt — follow the Failure Handling rule in [image-base.md](../references/image-base.md) §5: retry once, then mark the row `Needs-Manual`, report to user, and continue to the checkpoint above.

### Step 6: Executor Phase

🚧 **GATE**: Step 4 (and Step 5 if triggered) complete; all prerequisite deliverables are ready.

**Artifact ownership**: `svg_output/` is the author source, `svg_final/` is derived, and image facts come from the regenerated `analysis/image_analysis.csv`; see [`references/artifact-ownership.md`](../references/artifact-ownership.md).

Read the execution references for this deck's locked `mode` + `visual_style` (from `spec_lock.md`):
```
Read references/executor-base.md                  # REQUIRED: flat/shared execution core
Read references/shared-standards-core.md          # REQUIRED: SVG compatibility core
Read references/semantic-svg.md                   # REQUIRED: semantic metadata boundary
Read references/modes/<locked-mode>.md            # narrative skeleton (spec_lock.md `mode`)
Read references/visual-styles/<locked-style>.md   # aesthetic (spec_lock.md `visual_style`)
```

> Read only the five always-on references above plus the conditionally triggered modules below. For `mode: custom` or `visual_style: custom`, skip that preset file and follow `mode_behavior` / `visual_style_behavior` from `spec_lock.md` instead. Never glob `modes/` or `visual-styles/`.

| Deterministic trigger | Additional references |
|---|---|
| `pptx_structure.mode: structured` | `executor-structured.md` + `pptx-structure-interface.md` |
| Any data chart/table, including mini or inset charts and sparklines | `executor-chart.md` |
| Preset pattern or supported native chart/table | `native-data-interface.md` before drawing |
| `spec_lock.md images` or §VIII contains at least one image/formula row, or an active template carries bundled images | `executor-image.md` + `image-layout-spec.md` + `svg-image-embedding.md` |
| At least one placed image has `Status: Sourced` | `executor-web-image.md` after the image branch |
| The locked style/current page calls for noncanonical or alpha paint, dash/cap/join, tracking/decoration/outline, gradient/filter/glow/shadow, path/transform/clipping, or another constructed effect | `svg-effects.md` before authoring that value or effect |
| A page calls for a literal PowerPoint stock shape | `native-shape-authoring.md` before selecting or emitting that shape |
| All SVG pages and SVG quality gates are complete | `executor-notes.md` before generating speaker notes |

No branch is loaded by analogy. Evaluate these triggers from `spec_lock.md`, §VII/§VIII, the selected style, and the current page plan.

**Design Parameter Confirmation (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, output key design parameters from the spec (canvas dimensions, color scheme, font plan, body font size). See executor-base.md §2.

**Live Preview Auto-Startup (Mandatory)**: before the first SVG, automatically start the browser editor in live mode and keep it running continuously through Executor + Step 7 export:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_editor/server.py <project_path> --live --daemon
```
- Start it immediately when Executor begins; `svg_output/` may be empty. Editor opens at the launch-log URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:5050`; if another project already holds it, the launcher **auto-advances to the next free port** — read the actual URL from the launch log and report that.
- Treat the launch URL as a checkpoint value: before writing the first SVG, either report the actual URL from the launcher or state the launch failure explicitly. Do not silently continue while claiming preview is available.
- Run it as a long-running side process/session; do not wait for it to exit before generating SVG pages. Do not wait for user confirmation after startup.
- **Service must keep running** until one of: (a) the user clicks **Exit preview** in the browser, or (b) the user explicitly asks in chat to stop it. Generation continues even if the user closes the editor.
- **Do NOT read or apply submitted annotations during generation.** Users may annotate at any time, but Executor proceeds without touching them. The window to apply annotations opens only after Step 7 completes — see [`workflows/stages/live-preview.md`](stages/live-preview.md).
- The editor also supports **staged direct edits** (text content + SVG element attributes previewed immediately, then written to `svg_output/` only when the user clicks **Apply changes**; `Ctrl+Z` / Undo drops staged edits) alongside annotation; re-export stays chat-driven. Full scope and editor details: see [`workflows/stages/live-preview.md`](stages/live-preview.md) Notes.

**Conditional reference reads**: Follow `executor-structured.md` for template Design Spec/prototypes and `executor-chart.md` for `templates/charts/<key>.svg`. Both reuse unchanged `reference_set` path + SHA fingerprints; flat routes skip template reads. Summaries and sidecars never replace full SVGs.

> Image facts: trust the `analysis/image_analysis.csv` regenerated at the end of Step 5. If `images/` changed since (the user swapped or added files), re-run `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` before laying images out — facts are re-derived on use, never a stale store (Step 4 image-facts note).

**Per-page context load (Mandatory)**: before **each** SVG page, run:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/project_manager.py page-context <project_path> P<NN> --record-usage
```

Use `global` as the lock drift guard, `page_context` as the page delta, and `reference_set` under the Executor load policy. The retained Design Spec owns optional `Template Application`. This replaces neither gate artifacts nor source facts. See [`executor-base.md`](../references/executor-base.md) §2.1.

> ⚠️ **Main-agent only**: SVG generation MUST stay in the current main agent — page design depends on full upstream context. Do NOT delegate to sub-agents.
> ⚠️ **Generation rhythm**: P01 → first-page gate → uninterrupted remaining pages → final gate, in one context without batches or mid-run checker calls.

**Visual Construction Phase**: generate SVG pages sequentially, one at a time, in one continuous pass → `<project_path>/svg_output/`

Each completed SVG MUST be a standalone, complete representation of that slide's visible design. Template SVGs and locked planning artifacts may guide construction, but export must not reach back to them to add visible objects omitted from `svg_output/`. Speaker notes, animation, narration, transitions, and direct native-PPTX workflows remain separately owned artifacts/capabilities. When a page actually needs a literal stock shape, load and apply [`native-shape-authoring.md`](../references/native-shape-authoring.md) before drawing it. Diagram relationships remain Shape-first; do not infer a preset from contour similarity.

`template_reuse_scope: mirror|layout` pages MUST start from the complete `page_layouts` SVG, keep inherited visible objects, and preserve root Master/Layout identity plus stable atoms/slots. Strict preserves that reusable contract; under `layout`, the once-loaded Design Spec's `Template Application` may still authorize carrier text/tspan reflow inside unchanged slot bounds. Adaptive assigns a new Layout key/name and updates `spec_lock.md` when fixed atoms or slot topology/bounds change. `mirror` changes only visible text values while preserving text/tspan topology and attributes. `style` follows the flat paragraph below without structure metadata.

`template_reuse_scope: style`, free-design, and brand-only pages use `pptx_structure.mode: flat`. Draw the complete page directly: keep backgrounds, repeated chrome, headings, text, images, and decoration as ordinary Slide-local SVG content. Do not plan `pptx_masters` / `pptx_layouts` / `page_pptx_layouts`, do not add root Master/Layout identity, and do not add `data-pptx-layer` or `data-pptx-placeholder` metadata. Group logical content normally with top-level `<g id>` elements. Export materializes one clean project-owned Master plus one Blank Layout, applies the locked theme colors/fonts/title-body defaults, removes stock content placeholders and unused built-in Layouts, and retains only the standard date/footer/slide-number capability hooks. It does not promote or deduplicate page content.

Do not duplicate specialized identity with `data-pptx-role`. Add it only to structural page-frame objects whose package, page-number, or animation behavior is not already expressed by `data-pptx-layer`, `data-pptx-placeholder`, or `data-pptx-replace-with`; such an element needs a stable unique `id`. Do not add generic content roles to ordinary titles, body text, cards, KPIs, diagrams, charts, icons, or images. Full contract: [`references/semantic-svg.md`](../references/semantic-svg.md).

**First-page gate (Mandatory)** — after the **first** SVG page, before drawing page 2:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> --stage first-page
```
Fix P01 errors and rerun this gate as needed. After it passes, draw P02 through the final page without checker calls.

**Quality Check Gate (Mandatory)** — only after every planned SVG exists, BEFORE annotation handling and speaker notes:
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> --stage final --json
```
- **MUST**: Before this gate, every supported chart/table—including mini charts and sparklines—already has its own draw-time marker plus JSON metadata.
- Any `error` (banned/unsupported SVG features, invalid values, unresolved references, viewBox mismatch, etc.) MUST be fixed before proceeding — return to Visual Construction, regenerate that page, re-run check.
- Every `warning` is advisory and non-blocking: do not return the page for mandatory modification, do not auto-normalize user-authored compatible syntax, and do not require an acknowledgement/disposition line. Recommendation warnings identify the generated-SVG default; fidelity/quality warnings may be reported when material, but the existing input may ship unchanged. If a condition must be corrected before release, the checker must classify it as an `error`, not a `warning`.
- The same rule applies to structured-template warnings (empty/framing-only Layout, bare Master, duplicate layout keys): they may guide an optional template cleanup, but warnings alone never fail the quality gate. Flat `style`, free-design, and brand-only routes still rely on their existing hard errors for invalid structure metadata or incomplete required locks.
- Run against `svg_output/` (not after `finalize_svg.py` — finalize rewrites SVG and masks violations).
- The JSON report is written to `validation/svg_quality_report.json`. `inherited` prototype diagnostics and `source-import` compatibility losses are informational provenance; only changed/new warnings remain `introduced`, and all release-blocking failures remain `blocking`.
- **Hard rule — token-safe report handling**: On a successful checker run, use the exit status and terminal summary as gate evidence. Do not open, `cat`, or otherwise load the complete JSON report into model context. Read it only for failure investigation, an explicit audit request, or a field absent from stdout; extract only the required field(s).

**Logic Construction Phase**: after the SVG quality gate passes, load [`executor-notes.md`](../references/executor-notes.md) and generate speaker notes → `<project_path>/notes/total.md`

**✅ Checkpoint — Confirm all SVGs and notes are fully generated and quality-checked. Run the applicable conditional gates below, then proceed to Step 7**:
```markdown
## ✅ Executor Phase Complete
- [x] Live preview started before the first SVG and kept available at the reported URL
- [x] P01 gate passed; remaining pages authored without checker calls
- [x] All SVGs generated to svg_output/
- [x] Every wrapped prose paragraph uses one `<text>` frame with `<tspan>` line breaks
- [x] svg_quality_checker.py passed (0 errors)
- [x] Speaker notes generated at notes/total.md
```

> **Chart pages?** If this deck contains data charts, run the [`verify-charts`](stages/verify-charts.md) quality-gate stage before Step 7 to calibrate coordinates. Skip if no chart pages.

> **Visual self-check (opt-in)?** If the user explicitly asked for a per-page visual re-pass on the SVGs ("跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看", "visual review", "check pages visually", etc.), run the [`visual-review`](stages/visual-review.md) quality-gate stage before Step 7. Do NOT run it by default and do NOT recommend it based on inferred model capability or deck size — trigger is user request only.

### Step 7: Post-processing & Export

🚧 **GATE**: Step 6 is complete; `svg_output/` contains every final page, `notes/total.md` exists, all required conditional quality gates passed, and the final SVG quality report has 0 errors.

🚧 **Image readiness GATE**: When any required resource row is `Needs-Manual`, every expected file and derived slice output MUST exist under `<project_path>/images/` before Step 7.1. If any file is absent, pause and list the exact filenames. After the files arrive, rerun `analyze_images.py`, replace each dashed placeholder in `svg_output/`, reconcile every `no-crop` container to the measured native ratio, then rerun the final SVG quality check so the gate covers the changed sources.

**Failure recovery**: On a command failure, repair the owning source artifact and resume from that failed sub-step per [`failure-recovery.md`](./governance/failure-recovery.md). Do not restart planning unless its owning source changed.

**Hard rule — strict serial commands**: Run the following commands one at a time. Do not combine them in one code block or shell invocation. Enter the next sub-step only after the current command exits successfully and its success criterion is true.

#### Step 7.1 — Split Speaker Notes

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/total_md_split.py <project_path>
```

**Success criterion**: Per-slide Markdown files exist under `<project_path>/notes/` and cover every published slide.

#### Step 7.2 — Build the Self-Contained SVG Preview

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/finalize_svg.py <project_path>
```

**Success criterion**: `<project_path>/svg_final/` contains one self-contained preview SVG for every published slide. This mandatory derived preview does not replace `svg_output/` as the native-export source.

#### Step 7.3 — Export the Native PPTX

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path>
```

**Success criterion**: The command exits successfully and produces:

- `exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>.pptx`
- `validation/<project_name>_<timestamp>.report.json` with `passed` or `passed-with-warnings` package/resource postflight status

The command prints a compact `[POSTFLIGHT]` receipt containing `status`, `quality_gate`, Slide count, warning-category counts, and the PPTX/report paths. Use that receipt as completion evidence and disclose its material warnings to the user. Do not open or `cat` the complete report on routine success; use targeted field extraction only for failure investigation, an explicit audit request, or information absent from the receipt. A failed report or missing PPTX is not success.

## ✅ Generate PPTX Complete

- [x] Image readiness gate passed
- [x] Notes split completed
- [x] `svg_final/` preview completed
- [x] Native PPTX published and postflight report written
- [ ] **Next**: Report the exported PPTX path; run a supporting post-export stage only when its explicit trigger is present
