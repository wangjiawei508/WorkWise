# Third-party notices

This sidecar contains the following audited components. The notices are kept
next to the helper so packaging remains correct even when a downstream fork
does not retain the repository-level notice file.

## Microsoft MarkItDown

WorkWise packages Microsoft MarkItDown v0.1.4 at commit
`932084c88679aeda901c2903a151f3ed82f86081` under the MIT License. Only the
PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX format extras are enabled; `markitdown-ocr` is not
included.

bounded local PDF inspection and preview rendering.

## MinerU

MinerU is not bundled in this sidecar. WorkWise may optionally use a locked
MinerU 3.4.x local engine or an authorized private deployment. MinerU uses
the MinerU Open Source License, based on Apache 2.0 with additional conditions.
